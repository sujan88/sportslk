 <h4 style="color:#003">SQUASH SPORT RULES</h4>
 <h4 style="color:#009">The court</h4>
<strong>The  squash court is a playing surface surrounded by four walls. The court surface  contains a front line separating the front and back of the court and a half  court line, separating the left and right hand sides of the back portion of the  court, creating three 'boxes' - the front half, the back left quarter and the  back right quarter. Both the back two boxes contain smaller service boxes. All  of the floor-markings on a squash court are only relevant during serves.<br />
   There  are four walls to a squash court. The front wall, on which three parallel lines  are marked, has the largest playing surface, whilst the back wall, which  typically contains the entrance to the court, has the smallest. The out line  runs along the top of the front wall, descending along the side walls to the  back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck  above or on the out line, on any wall, are out. The bottom line of the front  wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck  means that the ball is out. The middle line of the front wall is the service  line and is only relevant during serves.</strong></h4>
 <h4 style="color:#009">Service </h4><strong>Just  before the match, the players spin a racket (usually up or down of logo) to  decide who serves first. This player starts the first rally by electing to  serve from either the left or right service box. For a legal serve, one of the  server's feet must be touching the service box, not touching any part of the  service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the  racket, the ball must strike the front wall above the service line and below  the out line and land in the opposite quarter court. The receiving player can  choose to volley a serve after it has hit the front wall. If the server wins  the point, the two players switch sides for the following point.</strong></h4>
 <h4 style="color:#009">Play </h4>
 <h4><strong>After  the serve, the players take turns hitting the ball against the front wall,  above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back  walls at any time, as long as it hits below the out line. It must not hit the  floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball  landing on either the out line or the line along the top of the tin is  considered to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to  bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back  walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the  court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements  is forbidden. Players typically return to the center of the court after making  a shot.</strong></h4>
 <h4 style="color:#009">Side-out (or hand-out) scoring system / English  scoring </h4>
 <h4><strong>This  scoring system is based on a &ldquo;serving&rdquo; system, in which one must gain the serve  to obtain a point. Having the serve is sometimes considered to be on &ldquo;offense&rdquo;.  The opponent (who does not have the serve) is considered to be on the defensive  and must score to win the serve and then score again to gain a point.<br />
   Points  are awarded if, during the course of play:</strong></h4>
 <h4><strong>The receiver fails to strike the ball before it  has bounced twice. </strong><strong>The receiver hits the ball out (either on or  above the out line, or on the tin)or misses the front wall.</strong></h4>
 <ul>
   <li><strong>Stroke: where the receiver obstructs the server  during the point (see &ldquo;Interference and Obstruction&rdquo;)</strong></li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Where  the server does any of these things, or fails to hit the serve in, then the  players change roles and the receiver will serve the next point, but no points  are awarded.<br />
   Games  are played to either 9, 11 or 21 points (with the exception that the receiver  may opt to call &quot;set two&quot; and play to 10 when the score first reaches  8-8). Competition matches are usually played to &quot;best-of-five&quot; (i.e.,  the player to win the most out of 5 games). At one time this scoring system was  preferred in Britain, but also among countries with traditional British ties,  e.g. Australia, Canada, Pakistan, South Africa, India, but now at competitive  levels, only PARS to 11 is used (see below).</strong></p>
 <h4 style="color:#009">Point a rally scoring system (PARS) / American  scoring </h4>
 <h4><strong>Alternatively,  in the point-a-rally scoring system (PARS), also known as American scoring,  points are scored by the person who wins each rally, whether or not he or she  served. The winner of the previous point will serve at the start of the next  point. Traditionally, PARS scoring was up to 9 points (or the receiver calls 9  or 10 when the game reaches 8-8). However, in 2004, the PARS scoring was increased  to 11 for the professional game (if the game reaches 10-10, a player must win  by two points).PARS is now used on the men's Professional Tour,  and the tin height has been lowered by two inches for the men's professional  tournaments (these changes have been made in a hope to shorten the length of  the rallies and therefore the match). The women's Professional Tour uses the  original tin height, but started using the PARS to 11 scoring system as of July  2008. In the International game, club, doubles and recreational matches are  usually played using the traditional British scoring system, but the European  Squash Federation (ESF),&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Squash_Federation" title="World Squash Federation">World Squash Federation</a>&nbsp;(WSF) and several national federations are now using PARS to 11 on  a trial or permanent basis. Scoring systems and rules can be adapted subtly to  accommodate shorter game time or multiple players. As of April 1, 2009, WSF has  declared that PARS to 11 will be the only official scoring system allowed for  all levels of competitive squash.</strong></h4>
 <div>
   <h4 style="color:#009">Referee </h4>
   <strong>The  referee is usually a certified position issued by the club or assigned squash  league. The referee has dominant power over the squash players. Any conflict or  interference is dealt with by the referee. The referee may also issue to take  away points or games due to improper etiquette regarding conduct or rules.  Refer to &ldquo;Interference and Obstruction&rdquo; for more detail.</strong></div>
 <div>
   <h4 style="color:#009">Types of shots played </h4>
   <h4>There  are many types of shots played that lead to interesting games and strategy.</h4>
 </div>
 <ul>
   <li><strong>Straight drive or 'rail': The ball is hit  parallel and close to a side wall to travel deep to the back of the court (the  'basic' squash shot). Often referred to as a 'good length' shot.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Boast (or angle): The ball is played off a side  wall at an angle, or the back wall, before hitting the front wall.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Volley: The ball is hit 'on the full' (before it  touches the floor), usually directly to the front wall</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Drop shot: The ball is hit gently against the  front wall, to fall softly to the floor in the front corner.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Lob: The ball is hit softly and high on the  front wall and with a high arc, so that it falls in a back corner of the court.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Cross Court: The ball is hit to the front wall  from the right side to the left (or vice versa).</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Kill: The ball is hit hard and low on the front  wall so that it travels no farther than half court.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Trickle boast: A 'short' boast where the ball is  hit to the side wall at the front of the court (often disguised as a drive or  drop shot).</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Squeeze boast: A more difficult shot which is  hit from the front of the court when the ball is very close to the side wall.  Has the same effect as the trickle boast but is more deceptive because of its  difficulty.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Skid boast: The ball is hit high to the side  wall near the front wall so that it travels cross court and falls in the  opposite back corner.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Nick shot: the ball is 'volleyed' or hit off a  bounce, cross court and with power to strike the front wall then the junction  of the side wall and floor (the 'nick'). When hit well, the ball will have  little or no bounce or roll along the floor (this is a more advanced shot that  is a variation of the kill shot).</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Back wall shot: the ball is hit moderately hard  and high off the back wall, so that it goes the length of the room and hits  (usually low) off the front wall.</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Corkscrew: A shot played diagonally upwards into  the front corner hitting the front wall first and then the side wall. The ball  then lobs over the court with significant spin. Ideally it hits the opposite  side wall at the back and travels parallel to the rear wall making a return  very difficult. This shot is a favourite in exhibition squash but is  susceptible to being volleyed.</strong></li>
 </ul>
 <div>
   <h4 style="color:#009">Strategy and tactics</h4>
   <h4><strong>A  key strategy in squash is known as &quot;dominating the T&quot; (the  intersection of the red lines near the centre of the court where the player is  in the best position to retrieve the opponent's next shot). Skilled players  will return a shot, and then move back toward the &quot;T&quot; before playing  the next shot. From this position, the player can quickly access any part of  the court to retrieve the opponent's next shot with a minimum of movement.<br />
     A  common strategy is to hit the ball straight up the side walls to the back  corners; this is the basic squash shot, referred to as a &quot;rail,&quot;  straight drive, wall, or &quot;length.&quot; After hitting this shot, the  player will then move to the centre of the court near the &quot;T&quot; to be  well placed to retrieve the opponent's return. Attacking with soft or  &quot;short&quot; shots to the front corners (referred to as &quot;drop  shots&quot;) causes the opponent to cover more of the court and may result in  an outright winner. Boasts or angle shots are deliberately struck off one of  the side walls before the ball reaches the front. They are used for deception  and again to cause the opponent to cover more of the court.<br />
    Rallies  between experienced players may involve 30 or more shots and therefore a very  high premium is placed on fitness, both aerobic and anaerobic. As players  become more skilled and, in particular, better able to retrieve shots, points  often become a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attrition_warfare" title="Attrition warfare">war of attrition</a>. At  higher levels of the game, the fitter player has a major advantage.</strong></h4>
