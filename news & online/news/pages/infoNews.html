The man was affectionately known as 'Our Enry' and collected a host of honours thanks to his fierce left hook called 'Enry's Ammer'.
The retired English heavyweight famously fought Ali - then known by his birth name Cassius Clay - twice, firstly in 1963 at Wembley Stadium.
In the final seconds of the fourth round Cooper felled firm favourite Ali with a jab of his left hook, but his head hit the ropes - not the floor - so it did not count.

Their merits and qualities to succeed in this type of cricket have been the subject of hours of engrossed discussions among the young and old as also renowned evaluators of cricket. In the end many would have glittered more than the present day superstars.

But all eyes now are on Sri Lanka's performances on World Cup 2011 from February 19 to April 2, some matches of which will be played in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's first match is against Canada at Hambantota on February 20.
<br />

Cricket has always been a popular game in the subcontinent where since the early '50s, games have drawn full houses not merely in Test matches but wherever they have played. With the introduction of one-day cricket however, the original form of the game has certainly taken a backseat, but the game's following has grown even more. What a feast ensuing World Cup will be when not one but all the cricket playing nations will descend on the subcontinent.

Obviously, the biggest attraction for a paying public-fed on many drawn Tests for a long time, is a feast of matches with much action is packed in a short period of time at the end of which there is a conclusive result.

<br />
<br />
So fickle is the nature of this game that the mightiest can fall to the weakest because there is no second innings for the redeeming act. There is very encouraging and influencing factor for the weaker teams. Players direct all their effort and energy towards one goal…. VICTORY.
All eyes on Sangakkara

What all Sri Lankans want to happen is the result of '96. If it can be repeated in 2011? However, the Lankans will do well not bank too much on optimism, but play the game with all the determination to get positive results in the matches. Kumar Sangakkara who leads the Lankan side no doubt will make every effort to keep the team in high spirits to get to the ultimate goal. The Lankan Captain is batting well right now and big things are expected from him.It is held that dashing allrounders form the nucleus of limited overs.Is there anyone around these days who is equal to Learie Constantine, Keith Miller or Sir Gafield Sobers? If transfers were permitted in cricket would not have record fees been paid for them? English critics looked in awe and disbelief at the batting and bowling genius of Constatine. And as he pounced on a ball to fling it back straight and flat at high speed those watching looked at one another in wonderment.
